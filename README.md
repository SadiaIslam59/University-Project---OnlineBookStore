![libraryimage](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a0bace8-e2f6-4620-8424-7e22052f0dd5)

In this project, I have used basic HTML CSS and PHP to build a simple online book store, which has 2 sides Admin Section and Users section. <br> <br>
In the User Section,  users can view, search, save books book, and register and log in with valid user information. <br> <br>
In the Admin Section, an admin can add, delete, update books, view user's information, and delete any users.<br><br>
This project also has a database.
